# Manabi

Education scheduler for RUHacks 2022.

## Inspiration

After spending countless hours waiting for Office Hours, we decided to make our own application to allow students to schedule meetings with each other, based on their own topics!

## What it does

Manabi allows students to sign in with their Google accounts, giving them access to the meetings that other students post. Simply choose a date, title, and a link for their meeting, and post for everyone to see!

## How we built it

We used React, HTML, and CSS for the frontend components and UI, with Firebase for the authentication system and database.

## Challenges we ran into

Since the majority of the team was unfamiliar with the technologies that were used, it was difficult to self-teach React/Firebase in such a short period of time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating a full stack project that functions as we intended, and uses technologies that we learned on the spot!

## What we learned

We learned how to use React and Firebase to create a full stack application, and how to work as a team using Git and GitHub!

## What's next for Manabi

Implementing a unique user identity and allow for deletion of meetings.
